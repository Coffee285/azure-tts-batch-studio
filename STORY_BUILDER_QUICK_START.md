Focus on atmosphere over gore.
Use sounds to build tension.
Target: 15 minutes (about 2,250 words).
```

### Step 3: Generate Your Story

**Example Prompts**:

*For Horror*:
```
Write the opening scene of a horror story about a woman working alone 
in a high-rise office building at 3 AM. She hears footsteps approaching 
her cubicle, but when the lights go out, she realizes she's not alone. 
Include sound effect markers like [SFX:footsteps_echo] and build tension 
slowly. End on a cliffhanger.
```

*For Deep Web*:
```
Write the opening of a story about a computer programmer who discovers 
a mysterious website that seems to know everything about them. Include 
realistic tech details and sound effects like [SFX:keyboard_typing] and 
[SFX:notification_ping]. Make it paranoid and unsettling.
```

*For Alien*:
```
Write the opening of a sci-fi horror story about a SETI researcher who 
receives an unexpected signal from space. It's not a greeting - it's a 
warning. Include space ambience sounds and build cosmic dread. Use 
sound effects like [SFX:radio_static] and [SFX:computer_beep].
```

*For Anachronism*:
```
Write the opening of a time displacement horror story about someone who 
finds a photograph from 1947 showing themselves in it. Include period 
details and temporal distortion effects. Use [SFX:clock_ticking] and 
[SFX:temporal_distortion].
```

### Step 4: Continue Your Story

4. For the next part, write: "Continue the story. [Brief direction for next scene]"
5. Click **Send** again
6. Repeat until your story is complete

### Step 5: Export for TTS

1. Click **Export** to combine all parts
2. Switch to the **Text-to-Speech** tab
3. Paste your story
4. Select a voice (e.g., "en-US-GuyNeural" for male narrator)
5. Click **Generate Speech**

## Method 2: Using Story Builder V2 (Advanced)

3. Render audio with **Render Beat**

## Story Duration Guidelines

## Tips for Great Horror Stories

### Pacing
- **First 20%**: Setup and normal world
- **Next 50%**: Building tension and escalation
- **Next 20%**: Descent into horror
- **Last 10%**: Climax and resolution

### Atmosphere
- Use all five senses (not just sight)
- Include ambient sounds with [SFX:...] markers
- Describe what characters feel, not just see
- Build slowly - don't rush to the scary parts

### Sound Effects
Always include sound effect markers in your prompts:
- `[SFX:door_creak]` - creaking door
- `[SFX:footsteps_echo]` - echoing footsteps
- `[SFX:heartbeat_fast]` - rapid heartbeat
- `[SFX:wind_howl]` - howling wind
- `[SFX:static_radio]` - radio static
- `[SFX:breathing_heavy]` - heavy breathing

### Ending Your Story
- Don't over-explain the horror
- Leave some mystery
- Consider an ambiguous or twist ending
- Optional: hint at lingering threat

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Too Fast**: Don't rush to the horror. Build atmosphere first.
‚ùå **Over-explaining**: Mystery is scarier than full explanation.
‚ùå **Generic**: Avoid overused tropes (haunted dolls, jump scares).
‚ùå **No Sounds**: Remember to include [SFX:...] markers for audio.
‚ùå **Wrong Length**: Check word count to hit your target duration.

## Model Selection Guide

### GPT-4
- **Best for**: High-quality prose, complex plots
- **Cost**: Higher (~$0.03-0.06 per 1000 tokens)
- **Speed**: Slower
- **Use when**: Quality matters most

### GPT-3.5-Turbo
- **Best for**: Faster drafts, iteration
- **Cost**: Lower (~$0.0015-0.002 per 1000 tokens)
- **Speed**: Faster
- **Use when**: Drafting or on budget

### Temperature Guide
- **0.6-0.7**: More focused, consistent, good for refining
- **0.8**: Balanced creativity and coherence (recommended)
- **0.9-1.0**: More creative and unpredictable, good for ideas

## Next Steps

1. **Read the Templates**: Check out the genre templates for detailed guidance
2. **Experiment**: Try different prompts and see what works
3. **Iterate**: Generate, edit, regenerate specific parts
4. **Test Audio**: Convert small sections to test pacing
5. **Build Library**: Save successful prompts for future use

## Troubleshooting

**"API Key Invalid"**
- Check Settings ‚Üí Story Builder Configuration
- Ensure key starts with "sk-"
- Verify key is active on OpenAI platform

**"Generation Too Short"**
- Increase Max Output Tokens (try 2000-3000)
- Be more specific in prompt about desired length
- Try "Write 1000 words about..."

**"Story Not Scary"**
- Check temperature (try 0.8-0.9)
- Be more specific about tone in instructions
- Add examples of desired atmosphere
- Use "unsettling", "dread", "tension" in prompts

**"Inconsistent Characters"**
- Add character details to Instructions panel
- Reference earlier parts in prompts
- Increase K value to include more context

**"Too Expensive"**
- Use GPT-3.5-Turbo instead of GPT-4
- Reduce Max Output Tokens
- Generate smaller sections
- Edit and combine manually
