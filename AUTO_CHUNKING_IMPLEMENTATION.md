# Auto-Chunking TTS Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Azure TTS Batch Studio now automatically handles Azure TTS request size limits through progressive budget reduction, eliminating "Completed with errors" scenarios when processing very long text.

## How It Works

### 1. Enhanced Error Detection
- `TtsException` class categorizes Azure errors by type:
  - `PayloadTooLarge`: 413 or size-related 400 errors  
  - `RateLimited`: 429 or throttling errors
  - `ServiceUnavailable`: 5xx server errors
  - `NetworkError`: Connection issues
  - `InvalidRequest`: 400 validation errors

### 2. Adaptive Budget Management
- `AdaptiveBudgetManager` tracks current chunk size budget
- Starts with `TargetChunkChars - SafetyMarginChars` (default: 2000-250=1750)
- On size errors, reduces budget by 15% (85% of current)
- Minimum budget prevents chunks smaller than `MinChunkChars` (1400)

### 3. Progressive Retry Logic
- `ProcessTextWithAdaptiveBudgetAsync` wraps existing processing
- When `PayloadTooLarge` occurs:
  1. Reduce budget by 15%
  2. Create new `TtsRenderOptions` with smaller `TargetChunkChars`
  3. Re-chunk the original input text
  4. Retry processing with smaller chunks
  5. Repeat until success or minimum budget reached

### 4. User Experience
- Status messages show: "Content too large, reducing chunk size to X chars and retrying..."
- Progress continues transparently without user intervention
- Final result is merged MP3 or separate files as requested
- Clear error messages if text cannot be chunked small enough

## Key Files Changed
- `TtsException.cs`: New error classification system
- `AzureTtsService.cs`: Enhanced to throw specific TtsExceptions
- `TtsOrchestrator.cs`: Added adaptive budget wrapper method
- `MainWindowViewModel.cs`: Uses adaptive method by default
- `TtsRenderOptions.cs`: Updated safety margin default to 250 chars
- Test files: Comprehensive coverage for new functionality

## Testing
- 56 tests passing including new adaptive budget tests
- Tests cover chunking behavior, error handling, and safety margins
- Tests verify SSML well-formedness and sentence boundary respect

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- UI controls already existed and work as before
- Enhanced behavior is transparent to existing users
- Legacy `ProcessTextAsync` method still available if needed

## Result
Users can now paste arbitrarily long text and get complete audio output without manual intervention or "Completed with errors" messages.
