### Example Opening Scene

```
## Beat 1: The Rabbit Hole

Marcus refreshed his browser for the third time. Still nothing. The forum thread had been deleted, but not before he'd saved the link buried in page 47 of the replies.

[SFX:mouse_clicking]

He shouldn't have been on r/UnsolvedMysteries at 2 AM. He should have been sleeping. But the discussion about the "Mariana's Web" urban legend had mentioned something he'd never heard before: an actual onion address. A real one.

His VPN was active. Tor browser open. The address sat in his clipboard, innocuous-looking: a string of random characters ending in .onion.

[SFX:keyboard_typing]

Marcus paused, fingers over the keys. Curiosity versus common sense. The thread had been clear: "DO NOT VISIT THIS SITE. It finds you. It remembers."

But that was just creepypasta nonsense. Right?

[SFX:enter_key]

He pressed Enter.

The page loaded slowly, line by line, like the old dial-up days. Black background. White text. No images. No styling. Just a single line of text:

"Hello, Marcus."

[SFX:heartbeat_fast]

His blood ran cold. His username wasn't Marcus. He never used his real name online. Never.

Then, below the greeting, a new line appeared:

"We've been expecting you."

[SFX:notification_ping]

Another line:

"You have 72 hours to complete the task."

"What task?" Marcus muttered, his hands trembling.

[SFX:typing_notification]

The cursor blinked. Someone—something—was typing a response in real-time:

"Check your email. The one you think we don't know about."

Marcus's personal email. The one connected to nothing, used for nothing, known to no one. His heart hammered as he switched tabs.

[SFX:mouse_clicking]

One new message. Subject line: "Your First Test."

He clicked it. Inside, a single attachment: a video file named "Marcus_LastSunday_1847.mp4"

Last Sunday. 6:47 PM. That was... that was when he'd been alone in his apartment, cooking dinner, his laptop closed.

[SFX:file_download]

The file downloaded automatically. Marcus tried to close the window, but nothing responded. The video player opened on its own.

Play.

[SFX:video_playback]

The footage was from inside his apartment. His kitchen. The angle from his laptop's webcam. But his laptop had been closed. He was sure of it.

On screen, Marcus moved around his kitchen, oblivious. Then the camera angle shifted. Moved. As if someone was...

"No," he whispered.

The footage paused on his face, looking directly at the camera with a spoonful of pasta halfway to his mouth. Text overlaid the frozen image:

"Task 1: Delete this video. You have one hour. If you succeed, we'll give you Task 2. If you fail..."

The message ended there, but a new window opened. A live video feed. His own webcam.

[SFX:webcam_activation]

Staring back at him was his own terrified face.

And in the chat window on the mysterious site, a new message appeared:

"We're watching, Marcus. We're always watching. Now, can you make us stop?"
```

### Writing Guidelines

**Do**:
- Use realistic tech terminology (but explain it narratively)
- Build paranoia through small details
- Show the protagonist's technical knowledge (or lack thereof)
- Create a sense of powerlessness against digital threats
- Use interface elements (chat logs, error messages) as narrative tools
- Make the online threat bleed into real life

**Don't**:
- Include real dark web URLs or illegal content
- Make technology do impossible things (keep it believable)
- Ignore basic computer security in unrealistic ways
- Rely solely on jump scares
- Make it overly technical that readers get lost

### Content Constraints
- No real illegal content descriptions
- No instructions for accessing actual dark web
- No glorification of illegal hacking
- No real person doxxing or harassment
- Suggest danger rather than show graphic content

### Technical Elements to Include

**Authenticity Markers**:
- Tor browser and .onion addresses
- VPNs and anonymity concerns
- Encryption and security measures
- Digital forensics and traces
- Metadata and EXIF data
- IP addresses and geolocation

**Digital Horror Elements**:
- Impossible knowledge (how do they know that?)
- Violation of privacy
- Loss of control over devices
- Inescapable digital presence
- Real-world consequences from online actions

### Recommended Parameters

**For Outline**:
- Model: gpt-4
- Temperature: 0.7
- Focus on escalation and paranoia

**For Drafting**:
- Model: gpt-4-turbo
- Temperature: 0.8
- Keep technical details accurate but accessible
