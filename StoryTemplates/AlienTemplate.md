# Alien Horror / Sci-Fi Template

## Genre: Cosmic Horror / First Contact / Alien Invasion

### Story Duration
- **Target**: 20-45 minutes
- **Word Count**: 3,000-8,000 words

### Core Concept
Stories involving extraterrestrial encounters, alien artifacts, space exploration horror, first contact scenarios, invasion narratives, or cosmic revelations that challenge human understanding.

### Atmosphere and Tone
- **Tone**: Wonder turning to dread, insignificance, the unknowable
- **Mood**: Isolation (space), violation (body horror), incomprehensible intelligence
- **Themes**: Humanity's place in cosmos, communication barriers, survival, evolution
- **Avoid**: Generic "evil aliens," overused invasion tropes, Star Wars-style space opera

### Example Opening Scene

```
## Beat 1: Signal

Dr. Chen stared at the waveform on her monitor, coffee forgotten in her hand. In fourteen years at the Arecibo Observatory, she'd analyzed thousands of signals. Radio bursts from pulsars. Solar flares. The occasional satellite interference.

This was different.

[SFX:computer_beep]

"SETI detection protocol initiated," the system announced. Her heart skipped.

The signal repeated in a perfect twenty-three-second cycle. Mathematical. Deliberate. Impossible to be natural.

[SFX:keyboard_typing]

She ran it through every filter, every analysis tool. The data held. The signal was real, narrowband, coherent. And it was getting stronger.

"Source triangulation complete," the computer stated. "Distance: 4.3 light-years. Direction: Alpha Centauri."

[SFX:chair_scrape]

Chen stood up so fast her chair rolled backward. Proxima Centauri. Our nearest stellar neighbor. Four years ago, probes had found no signs of life there. Nothing. Just rocks and radiation.

[SFX:phone_ring]

Her phone. Director Martinez. He'd been monitoring remotely.

"Are you seeing this?" His voice was barely a whisper.

"I need confirmation," Chen said. "This could be equipment malfunction, interference—"

"It's confirmed. Green Bank picked it up. Parkes in Australia too. It's real, Chen. It's actually real."

[SFX:heartbeat_fast]

First contact. Humanity's first confirmed extraterrestrial signal.

She should have felt joy. Wonder. Instead, a cold knot formed in her stomach.

"Run the decryption protocol," Martinez ordered. "Let's see what they're saying."

Chen's fingers hesitated over the keyboard. Something felt wrong. The signal's strength. Its precision. The way it seemed to pulse like...

Like a heartbeat.

[SFX:data_processing]

The decryption ran. Prime numbers. Universal constants. Mathematical proofs. Standard first-contact protocol. Then came the message, translating letter by letter:

"QUIET. THEY LISTEN."

Chen frowned. "That doesn't make sense. Who's 'they'?"

"Keep going," Martinez said. "There's more."

[SFX:computer_processing]

More data decoded:

"SIGNAL DETECTED. TRIANGULATION COMPLETE. THEY COME."

"What?" Chen's voice cracked. "Who comes?"

The final line appeared:

"DISTANCE: 0.8 LIGHT-YEARS. ETA: 47 HOURS. HIDE."

[SFX:alarm_warning]

Warning klaxons erupted across the facility. But these weren't her alarms. These came from NORAD. From NASA. From every space monitoring station on Earth.

On her screen, new signals. Thousands of them. Not from Proxima Centauri.

From everywhere. Above. Below. All around Earth.

[SFX:radar_ping]

Not four light-years away.

Already here.

The phone crackled. Martinez's voice, terrified: "Chen, look outside. Oh god, LOOK OUTSIDE—"

The call cut off.

[SFX:static]

Chen ran to the window. The sky was wrong. Stars were moving. No—not moving. Occluded. Blocked by something vast.

Something descending.

[SFX:deep_rumble]

The warning from Proxima Centauri hadn't been a first contact message.

It had been a warning from the last survivors of another world.

And humanity had just broadcast its location to whatever silenced them.
```

### Writing Guidelines

**Do**:
- Ground alien concepts in science (even if speculative)
- Make aliens truly alien (different biology, psychology, communication)
- Use scale to evoke awe and terror
- Create tension through isolation and unknown
- Show human ingenuity and limitation
- Make first contact moments powerful

**Don't**:
- Make aliens just "humans in makeup"
- Ignore physics completely
- Use tired invasion clichés
- Make resolution too easy
- Anthropomorphize alien motives without reason
- Forget the "horror" in sci-fi horror

### Scientific Elements to Include

**Astronomy/Space**:
- Realistic distances and timescales
- Orbital mechanics and physics
- Radiation and space environment hazards
- Communications lag (light speed limit)

**Biology**:
- Alien biochemistry (silicon-based, methane, etc.)
- Adaptation to alien environments
- Cross-species communication barriers
- Contamination protocols

**Technology**:
- Current and near-future space tech
- Scientific instruments and methods
- Quarantine and safety procedures
- Analysis and classification systems

### Alien Design Philosophy

**Make Them Alien**:
- Different sensory organs
- Non-humanoid form
- Incompatible biology
- Strange communication methods
- Unfamiliar motivations

**Types of Alien Horror**:
1. **Physical**: Body horror, transformation, infection
2. **Psychological**: Sanity-breaking revelations, mind control
3. **Existential**: Humanity's insignificance, obsolescence
4. **Invasion**: Loss of autonomy, replacement, assimilation

### Content Constraints
- No graphic gore for shock value
- Avoid xenophobic or discriminatory themes
- Keep science-based even when speculative
- Suggest rather than describe extreme body horror
- Maintain wonder even within horror

### Recommended Parameters

**For Outline**:
- Model: gpt-4
- Temperature: 0.7-0.8
- Focus on escalation from wonder to horror

**For Drafting**:
- Model: gpt-4-turbo  
- Temperature: 0.8
- Balance hard sci-fi with horror elements

### Story Tone Examples

**Hard Sci-Fi Horror** (The Expanse, Arrival):
- Grounded in physics and biology
- Slow revelation of alien nature
- Focus on protocol and procedure breaking down

**Cosmic Horror** (Lovecraft, Annihilation):
- Incomprehensible alien intelligence
- Reality-bending revelations
- Sanity and understanding as casualties

**Invasion Horror** (The Thing, Invasion of Body Snatchers):
- Paranoia and trust issues
- Transformation and replacement
- Loss of humanity

Explore the unknown. Question humanity's place. Make the cosmos terrifying.
