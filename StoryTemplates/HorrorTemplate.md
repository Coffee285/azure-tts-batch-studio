### Example Opening Scene

```
## Beat 1: The New Office

Sarah stared at the computer screen, its pale glow the only light in the empty office. Three AM. Again. The promotion had seemed like a blessing three weeks ago, but the late nights were wearing her down.

[SFX:keyboard_typing]

She typed the final line of code and leaned back, rubbing her tired eyes. The building was silent at this hour—forty floors of sleeping offices, security guards making their rounds somewhere far below.

[SFX:air_conditioning_hum]

The air conditioning kicked on with its usual mechanical groan. Sarah reached for her coffee, found it cold, and grimaced. Just one more test run, she thought, then she could finally go home.

But as she moved to hit Enter, something made her pause. A sound. Faint. Like...

[SFX:footsteps_distant]

...footsteps.

She froze, listening. The sound came again, closer now. Heavy. Deliberate. Someone else was on this floor.

Her eyes darted to the digital clock: 3:13 AM. Nobody else worked these hours. Nobody else had access to this floor.

[SFX:footsteps_closer]

The footsteps stopped. Right outside her cubicle.

Sarah held her breath, staring at the fabric divider that separated her from the aisle. Through the gap at the bottom, she could see...

Shadow. Someone was standing there. Waiting.

"Hello?" Her voice cracked. "Security?"

No answer. The shadow didn't move.

[SFX:heartbeat_fast]

Sarah grabbed her phone with trembling hands, but before she could dial, the lights went out.

[SFX:power_down]

Complete darkness. And in that darkness, she heard it: breathing. Not hers.

Someone else was in there with her.

### Writing Guidelines

**Do**:
- Build tension gradually
- Use all five senses (not just sight)
- Create atmosphere through description
- Leave some things unexplained
- End beats on micro-cliffhangers
- Use silence effectively

**Don't**:
- Rely on shock value alone
- Over-explain the horror
- Make it predictable
- Use clichéd tropes (killer dolls, haunted mirrors)
- Rush the pacing
- Include graphic violence for shock value

### Content Constraints
- No hate speech or discriminatory content
- No sexual content or explicit material
- No glorification of self-harm
- No real-world tragedy exploitation
- Avoid excessive gore (suggest rather than describe)

### Narrative Voice Options

**First Person**: Immediate, personal, allows unreliable narrator
- "I heard the door creak open behind me..."

**Third Person Limited**: Close to protagonist, maintains mystery
- "She heard the door creak open behind her..."

**Third Person Omniscient**: Can reveal information protagonist doesn't know
- "The door creaked open. She didn't hear it. Not yet..."
