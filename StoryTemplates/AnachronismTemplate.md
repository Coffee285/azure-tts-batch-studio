### Example Opening Scene

```
## Beat 1: The Photograph

Emma dropped the box of old photographs, and they scattered across her grandmother's attic floor like fallen leaves. Dust motes danced in the shaft of afternoon sunlight cutting through the grimy window.

[SFX:box_drop]

"Careful up there!" her mother called from downstairs.

"I'm fine!" Emma knelt, gathering the black-and-white images. Her grandmother had passed three weeks ago, and now came the sad task of sorting through ninety-three years of accumulated life.

Most photos were standard fare: weddings, birthdays, stiff formal portraits. Then Emma froze.

[SFX:heartbeat_slow]

The photograph showed a street scene from what looked like the 1940s. Women in period dresses. Men in fedoras. A shop front with a sign: "Murphy's Pharmacy - Est. 1932."

Nothing unusual. Except...

[SFX:paper_rustle]

Emma brought the photo closer to her face. In the background, barely visible through the pharmacy window's reflection, was a person. A young woman, maybe twenty-five. Dark hair. Blue coat.

Emma knew that coat. She was wearing it right now.

The woman in the photograph was her.

"That's impossible," Emma whispered. She flipped the photo over. Her grandmother's handwriting: "Main Street, 1947. The day before the fire."

[SFX:clock_ticking]

The grandfather clock downstairs chimed. Emma counted: one, two, three... thirteen chimes.

Wait. Thirteen?

[SFX:temporal_distortion]

The attic light flickered. For just a moment—less than a heartbeat—everything changed. The cardboard boxes became leather trunks. The bare bulb became an oil lamp. The walls...

[SFX:reality_shift]

...then back to normal.

Emma's hands shook as she looked at the photograph again. The woman in the blue coat was clearer now. Definitely her face. But something else had changed in the image.

The woman was looking directly at the camera now. Directly at Emma.

And she was screaming.

[SFX:paper_crumple]

Emma dropped the photo. It landed face-up, and she saw new details that hadn't been there before. Behind the screaming woman, the pharmacy window was shattering. Flames. People running.

The fire. The one that had killed seventeen people on December 3rd, 1947.

[SFX:phone_vibrate]

Emma's phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number:

"Don't come to the pharmacy tomorrow."

Tomorrow? This made no sense. The fire was seventy-six years ago.

Another text:

"I'm warning myself. The loop always closes. You can't save them."

Emma's blood turned to ice. A third text:

"But you'll try anyway. You always do. I always do."

[SFX:grandfather_clock_chime]

The grandfather clock chimed again. One... two... three... thirteen.

[SFX:temporal_echo]

And then Emma heard it: the sound of footsteps below. Not her mother's. These were heavier. Slower. The footsteps of someone wearing boots.

Men's boots.

From 1947.

"Emma?" A man's voice, crackled with age, static, distance. "Emma, is that you? After all these years?"

She crept to the attic stairs and looked down.

[SFX:wood_creak]

A man stood at the bottom. Fedora. Suit. He flickered like a faulty television signal—sometimes solid, sometimes translucent.

"I've been waiting," he said. "We've all been waiting. The fire is tomorrow, Emma. It's always tomorrow."

"Who are you?"

The man smiled sadly. "Your grandfather. Though we never met. I died in the fire trying to save... well. Trying to save you."

[SFX:time_distortion]

The world shifted. Emma blinked, and suddenly she wasn't in the attic anymore.

She was standing on Main Street.

The pharmacy sign read: "Murphy's Pharmacy - Est. 1932."

A woman in a period dress walked past, gave Emma's modern clothes a strange look.

[SFX:old_car_passing]

An old Packard rumbled by.

Emma looked at her phone. No signal. The screen flickered, then displayed a date:

December 2nd, 1947.

Behind her, someone whispered: "You're early this time. Maybe that means you can change it. But I doubt it. I've tried seventeen times."

Emma turned. The woman in the blue coat. Older now. Tired.

Herself.

"The fire starts tomorrow at 2:47 PM," Future Emma said. "I've never been able to stop it. But maybe you will. Maybe this loop finally breaks."

[SFX:clock_ticking]

Somewhere, a clock was ticking. Counting down.

Counting down to tomorrow.

To the fire.

To December 3rd, 1947.

A day that had happened seventy-six years ago.

A day that was about to happen again.

### Writing Guidelines

**Do**:
- Research the historical period thoroughly
- Use period-appropriate language and details
- Create clear contrast between time periods
- Build dread through temporal displacement
- Make the anachronism meaningful to the horror
- Show how time works differently than expected

**Don't**:
- Use time travel as an easy solution
- Ignore causality completely (unless that's the horror)
- Make historical periods feel like costume parties
- Over-explain the time mechanism
- Forget the emotional toll of displacement
- Use anachronism just as a gimmick

### Historical Periods to Explore

**Victorian Era (1837-1901)**:
- Spiritualism, séances, Jack the Ripper
- Industrial revolution horrors
- Strict social codes and their violations

**World Wars (1914-1945)**:
- Trenches, shell shock, lost generation
- Holocaust, genocide, mass trauma
- Atomic age beginning

**Medieval (500-1500)**:
- Plague, superstition, witch hunts
- Feudal cruelty, peasant suffering
- Dark Ages as literally dark

**Ancient Rome/Greece**:
- Slavery, gladiatorial games
- Mystery cults, oracles
- Fall of civilizations

**Colonial America (1600s-1700s)**:
- Salem witch trials
- Early settlements, starvation
- Native American conflicts

### Temporal Horror Elements

**Types of Anachronism Horror**:
1. **Person Out of Time**: Modern person in past or vice versa
2. **Object Out of Time**: Artifact that shouldn't exist yet
3. **Knowledge Out of Time**: Information from future/past
4. **Time Loop**: Same events repeating
5. **Temporal Bleeding**: Past and present overlapping
6. **Causality Horror**: Actions creating their own cause

**Temporal Rules to Break**:
- Linear time
- Fixed past/future
- Single timeline
- Paradox impossibility
- Temporal isolation

### Content Constraints
- Research historical accuracy
- Avoid trivializing real tragedies
- No hate speech or period-appropriate bigotry glorification
- Acknowledge historical trauma sensitively
- Don't romanticize "simpler times"

### Recommended Parameters

**For Outline**:
- Model: gpt-4
- Temperature: 0.7
- Research historical details first

**For Drafting**:
- Model: gpt-4-turbo
- Temperature: 0.8
- Balance period details with horror elements

### Research Resources

Before writing, research:
- Period-specific daily life details
- Language and speech patterns of era
- Technology and tools available
- Social norms and taboos
- Major historical events
- Common names, occupations, prices

### Story Variations

**The Time Loop**: Same day repeating with horror
**The Displaced**: Wrong time, can't get back
**The Bleeding**: Past invading present
**The Cursed Artifact**: Object carrying its era's trauma
**The Witness**: Seeing historical horror unfold
**The Inheritor**: Descendant paying for ancestor's sins
