# Verification Report

## Summary of Changes
All requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented and verified.

## 1. Security Vulnerability Fix ✅
**Requirement:** Fix System.Text.Json 8.0.0 vulnerability

**Implementation:**
- Updated `System.Text.Json` from version `8.0.0` to `9.0.9`
- This fixes the high severity vulnerabilities:
  - GHSA-8g4q-xg66-9fp4
  - GHSA-hh2w-p6rv-4g7w

**Verification:**
```bash
$ dotnet restore AzureTtsBatchStudio/AzureTtsBatchStudio.csproj
# Output: No vulnerability warnings
```

## 2. Build Target Simplification ✅
**Requirement:** Discontinue portable versions and arm64, x86. Only x64 is needed.

**Implementation:**
- Updated `.csproj` RuntimeIdentifiers from `win-x64;win-x86;win-arm64` to `win-x64` only
- Updated `build.sh` to build only x64 target
- Updated `build.bat` to build only x64 target
- Removed portable package creation for x86 and ARM64

**Verification:**
```bash
$ dotnet publish --runtime win-x64 --configuration Release
# Output: Successfully published for win-x64
```

## 3. Voice Prosody Support Fix ✅
**Requirement:** Ensure accuracy in voices and their ability to modify speaking rate. Some voices have Speaking Rate and Pitch sliders entirely disabled claiming voice does not support speaking rate or pitch adjustments when in fact, it does.

**Problem Identified:**
The application was using overly broad pattern matching to detect voices without prosody support:
- Pattern: `["onyx", "nova", "shimmer", "echo", "fable", "alloy", "gpt", "turbo"]`
- This incorrectly flagged Azure Neural voices like "Onyx Turbo Multilingual (Male)" as not supporting prosody

**Solution Implemented:**
Updated `IsVoiceWithoutProsodySupport()` to use precise detection:
- Only marks exact OpenAI voice names as unsupported: "alloy", "echo", "fable", "onyx", "nova", "shimmer"
- Only marks voices starting with "gpt-" or "gpt4-" as unsupported
- All Azure Neural voices (including those with "turbo" in their display name) now correctly support prosody

**SSML Generation:**
The application generates SSML with Azure-supported prosody values:
- **Rate**: Uses predefined values (`x-slow`, `slow`, `medium`, `fast`, `x-fast`) based on numeric slider
- **Pitch**: Uses percentage-based values (e.g., `+10%`, `-5%`, `default`)

Both formats are fully supported by Azure Neural TTS voices per Azure documentation.

**Verification:**
- Added 4 new test cases covering:
  - Azure voices with "turbo" keyword should support prosody
  - Azure Neural voices with "Multilingual" in name should support prosody
  - Exact OpenAI voice names should NOT support prosody
  - SSML generation includes prosody tags for Azure voices with "turbo"

## 4. Test Coverage ✅

**Test Results:**
```bash
$ dotnet test --configuration Release
# Output: Passed! - Failed: 0, Passed: 72, Skipped: 0, Total: 72
```

**New Tests Added:**
1. `IsVoiceWithoutProsodySupport_ShouldDetectCorrectly` with additional test cases:
   - `"en-US-JennyMultilingualNeural"` → should support prosody
   - `"Onyx Turbo Multilingual (Male)"` → should support prosody
   - `"en-US-TurboNeural"` → should support prosody

2. `GenerateSsml_ShouldIncludeProsodyForAzureVoicesWithTurboKeyword`:
   - Verifies SSML includes `<prosody>` tags for Azure voices with "turbo" keyword
   - Verifies rate is correctly mapped to predefined values (e.g., 1.2 → "fast")
   - Verifies pitch is correctly formatted as percentage (e.g., 5.0 → "+5%")

## 5. Build Verification ✅

**Build Output:**
```bash
$ dotnet build --configuration Release
# Output: Build succeeded with 0 errors, warnings are only for existing code style issues
```

**Publish Verification:**
```bash
$ dotnet publish --runtime win-x64 --configuration Release
# Output: Successfully created executable at publish/win-x64/AzureTtsBatchStudio.exe
```

## 6. No Breaking Changes ✅

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing voices continue to work as before
- New voice detection logic is more accurate, not restrictive
- SSML generation logic unchanged (already using correct Azure prosody syntax)
- All existing tests pass (68 original + 4 new = 72 total)

## Final Status

✅ **All Requirements Met**

| Requirement | Status | Details |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Fix System.Text.Json vulnerability | ✅ Complete | Updated to 9.0.9, no vulnerabilities |
| Remove x86/ARM64 builds | ✅ Complete | Only x64 remains |
| Fix voice prosody support | ✅ Complete | Azure voices with "turbo" now work correctly |
| Verify nothing breaks | ✅ Complete | All 72 tests pass |
| Verify everything works | ✅ Complete | Build and publish succeed |

## Testing Recommendations

To manually verify the fix:
1. Run the application
2. Select a voice with "turbo" in the name (e.g., "Onyx Turbo Multilingual")
3. Verify the Speaking Rate and Pitch sliders are enabled (not grayed out)
4. Adjust the sliders and generate speech
5. Verify the speech reflects the rate/pitch adjustments

Expected behavior:
- Sliders should be enabled for all Azure Neural voices
- Rate adjustments should audibly affect speech speed
- Pitch adjustments should audibly affect voice tone
- Only exact OpenAI TTS voices (alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer) should have disabled sliders
