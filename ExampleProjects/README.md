## Story Structure Tips

From these examples, note the common structure:

### Short Stories (15 min / 2,250 words)
- **Setup (20%)**: 450 words - Normal world, character introduction

- **Climax (30%)**: 675 words - Full horror revealed, confrontation
- **Resolution (10%)**: 225 words - Aftermath, twist, or ambiguous ending

### Medium Stories (30 min / 4,500 words)
- **Setup (20%)**: 900 words
- **Rising Action (40%)**: 1,800 words - More complex investigation, false leads
- **Climax (30%)**: 1,350 words - Extended confrontation
- **Resolution (10%)**: 450 words

### Long Stories (45 min / 6,750 words)

- **Resolution (10%)**: 675 words - Tying up threads, final twist

## Sound Effect Guidelines

Based on examples, effective SFX usage:

### Frequency
- Every 100-150 words for ambient/background sounds
- Every 50-75 words during action sequences
- Sparingly during dialogue (only for specific effects)

### Types
- **Ambient**: Constant background (wind, hum, rain)
- **Action**: Specific events (door, footsteps, crash)
- **Emotional**: Enhancing feeling (heartbeat, breathing)
- **Transition**: Scene changes (fade, whoosh)

### Placement
```
Bad: He heard a noise. [SFX:door_creak] It was scary.

Good: He froze. [SFX:door_creak] The old hinges groaned in the silence.
```

## Prompt Engineering Patterns

From the examples, effective prompt patterns:

### Opening Beat Prompt Pattern
```
Write the opening scene (Beat X) of a [genre] story about [character], 
[their situation]. [Key detail about setting]. [Character motivation].

Write [word count] words. [Tone instruction]. End with [hook]. 
[POV instruction]. Include [specific elements].
```

### Continuation Prompt Pattern
```
Continue the story (Beat X). [What just happened in previous beat]. 
[New situation or development]. [Key action or event].

Write [word count] words. [Pacing instruction]. Include sound effects: 
[list]. [POV instruction]. End with [cliffhanger or transition].
```

### Refinement Prompt Pattern
```
Revise the previous beat to [improvement goal]. [Specific issue to fix].
Maintain [elements to preserve]. Improve [aspects to enhance].
Keep the same word count and POV.
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Based on examples, don't:
- ‚ùå Rush the setup - take time to establish normalcy
- ‚ùå Over-explain the horror - mystery is scarier
- ‚ùå Forget sound effects - they're crucial for audio
- ‚ùå Ignore continuity - reference previous beats
- ‚ùå Make it too long - stick to target word count
- ‚ùå Use clich√©s - the examples avoid overused tropes
- ‚ùå Start too scary - build gradually

## Testing Your Story

Before full TTS conversion:
1. Read it aloud - does it sound natural?
2. Check pacing - time yourself at 150 WPM
3. Verify SFX placement - are they enhancing or distracting?
4. Test with AI - does it maintain your voice?
5. Get feedback - have someone else read it
