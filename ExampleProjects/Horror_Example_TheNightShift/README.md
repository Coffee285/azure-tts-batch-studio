## Story Beats

### Beat 1: Setup
Security guard Marcus begins his first night shift at an old office building that's being renovated. It's empty, quiet, normal.

### Beat 2: First Signs
Strange sounds. Footsteps on floors above. Doors that were closed are now open.

### Beat 3: Investigation
Marcus checks the security cameras. Sees a shadow moving on the 7th floor. Goes to investigate.

### Beat 4: The Empty Floor
The 7th floor is completely empty. No furniture. No people. Just shadows.

### Beat 5: Escalation
The elevator stops working. Lights begin flickering. Marcus hears breathing that isn't his own.

### Beat 6: Trapped
Emergency exits are locked. Windows don't open. He's trapped in the building with whatever is in there with him.

### Beat 7: The Presence
He sees it clearly now. A shadow figure. It doesn't move right. It's not human.

### Beat 8: Confrontation
The shadow corners him in the security office. Marcus makes a desperate choice.

### Beat 9: Resolution/Twist
Morning comes. The day shift arrives. Marcus is found unconscious. But he's changed. And the shadow is gone... for now.

Focus on atmospheric tension, not jump scares.
Use sound effects liberally: [SFX:footsteps_echo], [SFX:door_creak], [SFX:light_flicker]
Keep sentences short and punchy during tense moments.
Build slowly - first 40% is setup and normalcy.
Use silence and absence of sound as effectively as sound itself.
No gore, no explicit violence - suggest rather than show.
End each beat on a micro-cliffhanger or moment of unease.

## Example Prompt for Beat 1

```
Write the opening scene (Beat 1) of a horror story about Marcus, a security guard 
starting his first night shift at an abandoned 12-story office building undergoing 
renovation. He's been unemployed for months and needs this job. The building is 
completely empty - no workers, no other staff. Just him and his security desk in 
the lobby.

Write 300-400 words. Establish normalcy before introducing anything unsettling. 
End with Marcus settling into his chair, starting his first patrol route at 
midnight. Third person limited POV. Include ambient sound effects like 
[SFX:keys_jingle] and [SFX:fluorescent_hum].
```

## Example Prompt for Beat 5 (Escalation)

```
Continue the story (Beat 5). Marcus is now on the 7th floor, where he saw the 
shadow on the cameras. The floor is completely empty - all furniture removed for 
renovation. As he explores with his flashlight, the elevator doors close and it 
descends on its own. The lights begin to flicker. He hears breathing that isn't 
his own - coming from behind him.

Write 400-500 words. Increase tension significantly. Use short sentences. Include 
sound effects: [SFX:elevator_descent], [SFX:light_flicker], [SFX:breathing_heavy], 
[SFX:heartbeat_fast]. Third person limited, Marcus POV. End with Marcus realizing 
he can't leave the floor - the stairwell doors are locked from the other side.

- Reflections in windows and glass

## Tips for Generating This Story

1. Start with Beat 1, get it right before moving on
2. Each beat should reference the previous one
3. Keep a consistent timeline (midnight to 6 AM)
4. Track Marcus's mental state - he should degrade gradually
5. The shadow should escalate from ambiguous to undeniable
6. Save the full reveal for Beat 7
7. Keep the entity's nature ambiguous - explain less, not more
8. The resolution should be unsettling, not comforting

## Variations to Try

- Make it more psychological (is Marcus hallucinating?)
- Make it more supernatural (entity has clear powers)
- Make it more grounded (homeless person? Corporate conspiracy?)
- Change the ending (Marcus escapes? Marcus doesn't?)
- Add a second character (another guard? Cleaning person?)
